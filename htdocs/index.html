<H3>What Is KeyboardAccess for IE</H3>
KeyboardAccess is an Internet Explorer add-on (or Browser Helper Object, BHO, in the Microsoft terminology). 
KeyboardAccess is intended to help the user browse the World Wide Web without using the mouse. It does 
its job by numbering the links on a web page, and allowing the user to browse to a link by 
entering the link's number, which is attached to it by KeyboardAccess.

<B>Improtant Notes:</B><BR>
<OL>
<LI>The installation must be done by a user of the administration group of the machine it's 
being installed on. After the installation all users will be able to use KeyboardAccess.
<LI>If you're upgrading from a previous version of KeyboardAccess, remove it first using the 
control panel's Add/Remove Programs menu. If KeyboardAccess's uninstallation says at the end 
of the uninstall that some files will be removed during the next reboot of the computer, 
then install the new version only after rebooting your computer!
