<H3>How To Use KeyboardAccess</H3>
<B>Activation:</B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Keypad &quot;+&quot; button <I>or</I> F12</B> - number the elements on the page and bring up 
the &quot;Choose Element&quot; dialog box.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Usage:</B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Enter</B> - Go to entered link number.<BR>
<LI><B>Esc</B> - Undo link numbering and close dialog box.<BR>
<LI><B>Alt + Up Arrow</B> - Scroll browser up.<BR>
<LI><B>Alt + Down Arrow</B> - Scroll browser down.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Tips:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Click the KeyboardAccess activation button when you already know which link you want to browse to, not earlier. That way the &quot;Choose Link&quot; dialog won't hide the web page while you're looking at it.
<LI>Hands positioning: The most useful way to use KeyboardAccess is to light up the NumLock and keep the right hand on 
the keypad. The thumb of your right hand can be on the Down Arrow button so you can scroll 
down easily. The left hand should stay near the left Alt and Tab buttons, because that's the 
most useful place to put it if you're going to use Windows with the keyboard.
<LI>KeyboardAccess should be fired after you already browsed the page and when you know which element you wish 
to click or focus on.
<LI>To open a link in a new window, you can either click ALT+N or click TAB once and then hit the space bar to 
check the checkbox.
</UL>
<B>General browsing tips with Microsoft Internet Explorer</B><BR>
<B>Note:</B> The following are not related to KeyboardAccess, and are just helpful if you want to 
browse without the mouse.
<UL>
<LI>Alt + Left Arrow <I>or</I> Backspace - like pressing the &quot;Back&quot; button.
<LI>Alt + Left Arrow - like pressing the &quot;Forward&quot; button.
<LI>Alt + D - Go to address bar.
<LI>Ctrl + F4 - Bring up most used links in address bar.
<LI>Up Arrow - Scroll up in current page (if doesn't work, click Tab and try again).
<LI>Down Arrow - Scroll down in current page (if doesn't work, click Tab and try again).
</UL>

<H3>To Do</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Add numbering to more items (combo-boxes, for example) so it will be possible to focus on 
them with KeyboardAccess.
<LI>Instead of the &quot;New Window&quot; check-box, allow showing the element's context menu (in case 
of a link the &quot;Open In New Window&quot; will be one of the options in the menu).
<LI>Add configuration editor (once the configuration parameters are clear).
</UL>

<H3>Thanks</H3>
Thanks to all the friends who helped me out by giving their comments about KeyboardAccess and helping in making 
it useful. Also for offering the name (you know who you are :).<BR>
Thanks to Nullsoft, the good people who provided the installer for this little software and allowed me 
to create a great looking installation without breaking the law.

<P>
<H3>Known Bugs and Their Workarounds</H3>
<B>Bug:</B><BR>
When the user interface is showing pressing ALT+F4 closes it without removing the element numbering.<BR>
<B>Workaround:</B><BR>
Close the window with ESC, or ALT+C (cancel), or by tabbing your way to the Cancel button and hitting the 
space bar.
<BR><BR>
<B>Bug:</B><BR>
When inside an form element, like an edit box, clicking &quot;+&quot; will add it to the text in the edit 
box.<BR>
<B>Workaround:</B><BR>
When in a form hitting Enter will usually submit it. To move around between from elements use TAB. In the 
case of forms, KeyboardAccess is useful only to focus on a field.
